#### Overview ‚ú®
------

A web app created in 14 days as part of my BrainStation course. Acumen seeks to modernize the job application process and mark a transition away from the paper resume to an immersive video interview. It is designed to change the way that employers and candidates look at recruitment.

Consider the way that technology and the internet of things have revolutionized all that is around us. We have only just touched the surface of what is possible with the recruitment process but unfortunately we have been working in the wrong direction.

Current tech application in the recruitment scope have worked to make the recruitment process more exclusive rather than inclusive. Acumen is not a tool to filter candidates, nor is it a tool to rate candidate eligibility based on arbitrary metric mapping. Rather it is a tool focused on connecting prospective candidates with employers.

Nothing is more demotivating for the average applicant than applying for a job with a company they love and to not have the opportunity to interview. It is smart for companies to be risk-averse, it is not smart for companies to be opportunity-averse.

This is not the fault of the recruiter. Many would love the opportunity to speak with every candidate and truly get to learn who they are as an individual and a professional. They simply don't have the time to schedule interviews with everyone. Acumen is here to help.

By allowing candidates the opportunity to record interviews of themselves, either pre-prepared or in a real-time environment. Prospective employers can more easily schedule the time to review candidates, review only the answers that matter most to them, they can direct interview questions, share candidates with team members, avoid the difficulty of timezones and more.

- React
- React Router  
- Firebase Authentication 
- Firebase Storage (For hosting image and video files)  
- Firebase Firestore (Database of choice)  
- SASS
- QR Code Generator

#### What's Next üìÖ
------
<p>As I have been busy with work I haven't had as much time as I would have wanted to revisit this project and improve upon the original development. At my next possible opportunity however I will be doing the following: </p>

- [ ] Revisit prior code to improve performance and implement best practices
- [ ] Add company profile building
- [ ] Fix authentication layer for LinkedIn
- [ ] Add AI (Tone-detection, Keyword Detection, Expression Detection)
- [ ] Greater profile customization
- [ ] Enhance candidate interviews
- [ ] Resume Compiler
